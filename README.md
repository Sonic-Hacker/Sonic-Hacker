- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sonic-Hacker and I greatly appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with you.
- 👀 I’m interested in all the things related to law, business and technology, especially Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Virtual Software Instruments and Effects (VST) and new applications that will transform the legal and medical professions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VST development in C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on audio plugins that can be used for forensic analysis and IP rights management.
- 📫 How to reach me ... hmmmm that's your first challenge ....
